## Experiment 3: The Effect of The Number of CPU Cores

### Experimental Setup

I execute my hierarchical clustering, changing the some parameters as bellow.  The data had been generated randomly. And then I measured the execution time for training each model.

- # Used Cores: 50 100 120 160
- # Clusters: 20 50 100
- # Rows: 500000
- # Dimensions: 100

### The Result of Training Execution Time

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(reshape2)
#result4 <- read.csv("./data/benchmark-cores.csv")
#result4$sec <- result4$trainMilliSec / 1000
```
